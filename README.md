## ✅ Implementation Status

The scaffold backlog in `FILE_CHECKLIST.md` is now fully completed (83/83 files).
Current implementation includes:

- Route-based app navigation and nested layout shell (`Header`, `Sidebar`, `Footer`, `FocusMode`)
- Core pages for home/auth/dashboard/courses/lesson/profile/settings/404
- Reusable UI primitives under `src/components/ui`
- Lesson and dashboard component modules under `src/components/lesson` and `src/components/dashboard`
- Initial hooks, Zustand stores, shared types, Supabase helpers, and starter SQL migrations/seed
- Hooks now support Supabase-backed reads/writes with local fallback when env is not configured
- Issue tracking and sequencing are maintained in `ISSUE_PROGRESS.md`

## 🗺 Roadmap

- [x] Project scaffold and documentation
- [ ] Authentication (Supabase Auth)
- [ ] User profiles and learning preferences
- [x] Core lesson components (text, audio, interactive)
- [ ] Adaptive learning algorithm
- [x] Progress dashboard
- [ ] Educator / parent portal
- [x] Mobile-responsive design
- [ ] Accessibility audit and fixes
- [ ] v1.0 release

## 🔒 Supabase Security Guardrails

These rules are **mandatory** for all contributors and must be enforced in code review.

### Service Role Key
- The **service role key** (`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`) bypasses Row Level Security.
- It must **never** be included in the client bundle (`src/`, `public/`).
- It is only permitted in Vercel serverless functions or other server-side runtimes.
- `utils/supabase/server.ts` is a placeholder for future SSR use — never import it from client components.

### Admin Role Assignment
- Users cannot self-assign `role = 'admin'` via the signup form.
  Migration `027_signup_role_from_metadata.sql` enforces this at the DB trigger level.
- Admin promotion must be done manually in the Supabase dashboard or via a
  server-side function using the service role key.

### Redirect Allowlist
- All auth redirect URLs (password reset, OAuth callbacks) must be listed in:
  - `supabase/config.toml` → `additional_redirect_urls` (local dev)
  - Supabase dashboard → **Authentication → URL Configuration** (production)
- Never trust user-supplied redirect parameters without validation.

### Developer Checklist (pre-merge)
- [ ] No `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` reference in `src/` or `public/`
- [ ] No `import … from 'utils/supabase/server'` in client components
- [ ] New auth redirect URLs added to both `config.toml` and Supabase dashboard
- [ ] New user-facing roles validated in `handle_new_user()` trigger
- [ ] RLS policies reviewed for any new tables
